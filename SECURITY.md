# Security

If you discover a security vulnerability, please do not disclose it publicly. Instead:

1. Open a private issue (use the repository's issue template and mark it as private) or open a draft PR and request reviewers in the repository: `https://github.com/drhiidden/betanet-tools/issues`.
2. Provide a clear description, steps to reproduce, and any PoC (prefer privately using the repository tools).

We will acknowledge receipt within 48 hours and coordinate a fix.
