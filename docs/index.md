# Documentation — Index

This folder contains the project's documentation. Per the current publishing policy, only the `docs/management/` section is public; other documents are private or under development.

- **Management** (public): business processes, bounties, CLA and contribution guides.
  - `docs/management/BOUNTY.en.md` — bounty process and rules
  - `docs/management/CLA.en.md` — CLA / terms of engagement template
  - `docs/management/README.md` — summary and usage

- **Other (private / not published)**: other documentation (utls-template, specs, communication, spec-linter) is currently in development and ignored by git; if you need access to a specific document, open an issue.

Quick pointers

- Before posting publicly (Discord etc.), review `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `LICENSE-*` and `SECURITY.md`.
- To propose a bounty, open an issue at: `https://github.com/drhiidden/betanet-tools/issues` and use the bounty template.

If you want files moved from private to public, tell me which ones and I will reorganize them.
